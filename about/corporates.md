While the majority of Farset Labs is self-funded by the community, we are also supported by local companies and bodies that recognise the transformative effect that our resources, projects and initiatives can have on the local community and economy. 

Corporate Members provide support or services that contribute to the core costs of Farset Labs and its core programmes, and each has the same voting power as a regular member.

Programme Partners contribute to specific projects and initiatives.

# Corporate Members

## Intel

Intel recently acquired Belfast based Aepona, whose awarding-winning software
platform bridges the enterprise with the network, enabling Service Providers
to offer communications, context, commerce and control features that enrich
business applications using cloud-based APIs. This allows Service Providers to
monetize their assets in new ways, and enterprises to easily embed mobile
intelligence into a diverse range of applications.

Special thanks have to go to [Weavers Court Business Park](http://www.weaverscourt.com/); without the confidence and tireless support of Tom Ekin, Gary Cassels, and the whole Weavers Court team, Farset Labs simply couldn't be.
