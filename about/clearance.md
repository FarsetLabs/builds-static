A single "Ticket List" Google Doc will be kept in Slack to record any items that have been ticketed, with 24h of ticketing, and to record any items agreed with Directors not to be moved (these should also be appropriately labeled).

Items will not normally be considered to have a Known Owner (and eligible for 60 day terms) unless they are clearly individually labeled, _with name and Slack handle_. While some members or Directors may be aware of ownership of unlabeled items, there is no necessity for those handling this process to ask. Please note that Slack notifications to a personal handle will be considered sufficient notification under the abandonment rules.

# Clearance System for Labeled Property

An item will normally be considered to have a Known Owner (and eligible for the 60 day timeline), if they have a name and valid Slack handle.

## Open spaces

Any items left unattended in public spaces will be Please-Move ticketed at any point, clearly with a date and photograph.

### Timeline for Known-Owner Property Removal

#### First time for a given item

1. Item ticketed
2. As soon as possible (preferably with 24h): Ticket List updated
3. &lt; 20 days: notification with Slack handle (if known) in #general
4. 30 days: item taken off-site
5. 40-50 days: notification with Slack handle (if known) in #general
6. 60 days: item available to be claimed [x]
7. 65 days: item will be disposed or sold with proceeds to Farset (if safe and legal to do so under consumer protections)

x: first refusal goes to Farset, exclusively via the Directors, then to any member in order of request (advance request available from ticketing date onwards)

A second notice should be raised 10 days before it becomes communal property. If the same item later appears again in a public space, having been removed, as the owner has previously been notified, no new notification is required. Any removed item should be kept on a publicly accessible list.

Off-site removal will only be actioned, or specifically delegated, by a Director or a NEM. Having exceeded the abandonment criteria in the Rules, security of storage is _not_ guaranteed, although reasonable efforts will be taken. Note that the 60 day term is from ticketing, regardless of any intermediary steps.

#### Subsequent instances for a given item

1. Item ticketed
2. 30 days: item taken off-site
3. 40-50 days: final notification with Slack handle (if known) in #general
4. 60 days: item available to be claimed [x]
5. 65 days: item will be disposed or sold with proceeds to Farset (if safe and legal to do so under consumer protections)

x: as above

If an owner requests access to an off-site item, it should be collected as promptly as can be arranged. If it is not retrieved as agreed, or otherwise promptly, the 60 day term will continue to apply from the original date.

## Public shelf storage

All items in public shelf storage will be ticketed on a monthly basis. From this point the timeline above applies, although items may remain in situ until the 60 days, and ownership transfers.

For clarity: once an item is ticketed, if it is subsequently moved to public storage, _the original open-space timeline still applies_.

## Private shelf storage

Individual arrangements will be made for private shelves for those already exclusively using them. For non-pre-allocated private shelves, a standard rental will apply.

# Clearance System for Unlabeled Property

This is covered in the Code of Conduct - the enactment process will be similar on the shorter (30 day) timelines described there.
