# Purpose
This document is intended to ensure clarity regarding the spending of Farset Labs money, through direct purchases or through expenses claims. It outlines the general procedures that must be adhered to, and the approvals that must be obtained prior to spending money.

# Spending of Money by Directors
Purchases and expenses must be approved before they are performed. 

The table below outlines the number of directors required to approve any given transaction.

| Value of Purchase                             | No. of Directors Required |
|---------------------------------------------- |-------------------------- |
| Less than or equal to £50                     | 1                         |
| Greater than £50, less than or equal to £100  | 2                         |
| Greater than £100, less than or equal to £250 | 3                         |
| Greater than £250                             | Unanimous                 |


Exceptions to approval limits:
* Payment of expected bills (Rent, Gas, Electricity, etc.)
* Recurring and expected purchases (Tuck shop stock)
* Emergency purchases (Purchases where there is no choice, the requisite number of directors are unavailable, and the purchase cannot be delayed. e.g. Plumbers)

# Spending of Money by NEMs
NEMs cannot spend company money without prior approval by company directors. When money is requested to be spent, there are two options:
* Submission of a purchase request via email to admin@farsetlabs.org.uk 
The item will be purchased by the directors if approved.
* Purchase of a pre-approved item using personal funds, followed by submission of an expenses claim on Xero.

The table below outlines the number of directors required to approve any given transaction.

| Value of Purchase                             | No. of Directors Required |
|---------------------------------------------- |-------------------------- |
| Less than or equal to £50                     | 1                         |
| Greater than £50, less than or equal to £100  | 2                         |
| Greater than £100, less than or equal to £250 | 3                         |
| Greater than £250                             | Unanimous                 |

# Travel Expenses
Expenses for travel may be reclaimed if the travel is company related, and pre-approved before being undertaken. Approval must be obtained prior to travel otherwise expenses are incurred at the traveller’s risk. 
Member/NEM travel expenses require the approval of a single active director. 
Director travel expenses require the approval of a director other than the requester.

The repayment table for travel expenses is shown below.

| Type of Transport   | Reimbursement (per trip)                |
