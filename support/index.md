# Support

## One Off Donations

Farset Labs is an accredited charity and is eligible to Gift Aid tax relief on one off donations. We are also certified by PayPal as being eligible to take part in their PayPal Giving Fund which absorbs PayPal's normal transaction costs for charitable donations. 

If you'd like to support our work in this way, follow the link below! Thanks!

For larger donations, it is often easier to [contact us](mailto:donate@farsetlabs.org.uk) to arrange a BACS payment and requisite [Gift Aid](https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid) paperwork.
