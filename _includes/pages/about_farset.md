### Who We Are
We are an inclusive group of students, professionals, academics, freelancers, artists, hackers, and organizers that believe strongly in experimental learning and the Do-It-Yourself ethic. We facilitate technology initiatives and encourage hands-on learning by maintaining a [workshop](/about/facility.html) and creative space that is available to members. We maintain an inclusive membership [policy](/about/rules_and_policies.html), and strive to apply the principles of the open-software and open-hardware movements within our design policies. In short, we are an immersive experiment into the hacker ethic.

The space is availiable to members 24/7 but if you would like to pop in, give us a shout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/farsetlabs) or [IRC](ircs://irc.freenode.net/farsetlabs) to see if anyone is about!
