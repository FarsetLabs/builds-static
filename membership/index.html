<h1>Benefits</h1>

They also get unlimited access to all of our equipment and events, as well as the affiliation with great like-minded people.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High-speed fibre Internet connection</strong> &amp; WiFi provided by Tibus</li>
  <li><strong>Hot-desking</strong> and access to the space anytime</li>
  <li><strong>Communal</strong> <strong>electronics equipment</strong>, tools, and components</li>
  <li><strong>Kitted-out workshop</strong> with a growing selection of hand tools &amp; machines</li>

<h1 id="membership-dues">Membership Dues</h1>

<p>There are three Individual Membership rates that we think represent three core uses of the space; </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Students</strong> (£15pm), that are occasionally in the space during the day, mostly experiment in the evenings, and are strapped for cash <sup id="fnref:cards"><a href="#fn:cards" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Enthusiasts</strong> (£25pm), that regularly use the space in the evenings and make regular use of the equipment and space, less strapped for cash</li>
  <li><strong>Freelancers</strong> (£35pm), that are consistently in the space, regularly hot-desking with ongoing long term projects under their belts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All Membership Dues go towards the core operation of the space; events and projects are normally funded by additional donations / sponsorships</strong></p>
