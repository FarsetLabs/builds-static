## User Groups
User groups have a free block-booking of Wednesday evenings, allowing any group with an interest in something vaguely technical or crafty to use the space for free (assuming noone else has got it first!). 

User groups are exempt from the evening day pass requirement, but donations are welcomed and encouraged.

Free User group bookings must be arranged in advance by emailing [events@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk) and are offered on a case by case basis at the discretion of the Directors / Events NEM.

Currently hosted user groups are:

* [Code Co-op](https://www.meetup.com/CodeCoop-NI)
* [Belfast Linux Users Group (BLUG)](http://www.meetup.com/belfast-lug/)
* [BelfastJS](http://www.meetup.com/Belfast-JS/)
* [Wordpress NI](http://www.meetup.com/Northern-Ireland-WordPress-Meetup/)
* [Belfast Google Developer Group](https://developers.google.com/groups/chapter/117880769522295112261/)
* [Cryptoparty Belfast](https://www.cryptoparty.in/belfast)

## "Have you guys thought about running....?"
If you've got an idea or suggestion for an event or programme that could be run at Farset Labs, don't hesitate to get in touch about your plans. We love encouraging and enabling people to put on interesting and exciting events in the space. 

If you're a member and you want to run something, just start discussing it on [Discourse](https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/category/events), get a plan together, and fire an email in to [events@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk) to book it into the calendar.
