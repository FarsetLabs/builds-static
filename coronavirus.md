### Plan for Easing out of Lockdown

Farset Labs will reopen access to the space in steps aligned with government guidance.

Given the several months of activity in the space prior to the lockdown, we estimate that there will be a small number of people (less than 10) in the space at any time, even with visitors.
However, we will phase in reopening access for **members** first, then **visitors** and later to small **events** to be safe.

**Social distancing** remains important so please give each other a respectful amount of space when choosing an area
to work and using shared facilities. **Signage and sectioning** will be in place to help.

**Sanitising products** and **personal protective equipment** will be made available to everyone in the space.
